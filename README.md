# Fractals-Imaging-With-Python


A simple fractals program adapted from Kirby Urner's code found [here](http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/FractalImage)
 - modified to provide coordinate positions upon mouse click
 - modified to allow rendering of either Julia or Mandelbrot


## Instructions

The program will allow you to create a render of the Julia or Mandelbrot fractal and look at specific sections of those fractals.
